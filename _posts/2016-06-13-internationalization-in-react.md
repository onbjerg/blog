title: Internationalization in React Using Higher-Order Components
---

A simple way to make your React SPA international is to use a higher-order component that wraps your other components.

This is what I came up with:

```js
import React from 'React'
import en from '../lang/en'
import da from '../lang/da'
â€‹
/**
 * Could be refactored in to JSON files that are lazily loaded. It could
 * also use a 3rd party localization service. Maybe.
 */
const languages = {
  en,
  da
}
â€‹
/**
 * A higher order component that makes our components international. ðŸ˜Ž
 */
export default function translate (key) {
  return Component => {
    class TranslationComponent extends React.Component {
      render () {
        var strings = languages[this.context.currentLanguage][key]
        return <Component {...this.props} {...this.state} strings={strings} />
      }
    }
â€‹
    TranslationComponent.contextTypes = {
      currentLanguage: React.PropTypes.string
    }
â€‹
    return TranslationComponent
  }
}
```

It's pretty simple, but thus far it has worked pretty good in my projects.

This is an example of a file with localized strings:

```json
{
  "MyComponent": { "hello": "Hello, world!" }
}
```

And this is an example usage:

```js
import translate from './translate'

const MyComponent = ({ strings }) =>
  (<div>{strings.hello}</div>)

export default translate('MyComponent')(MyComponent)
```
