Hi! I'm Oliver, a 19 year old self-taught developer. Currently I'm based in Copenhagen, and I spend most of my time writing code or reading as a developer in 3 different companies.

When I am not working I have a big passion for all things open source and open science. I try to contribute back to the community as much as possible.

I'm really opinionated, and as I rarely spend any of my time on debates anymore, this blog will probably come to contain a lot of my general opinion on various subjects.

If you need to get in contact with me, then you can usually reach out to me on Twitter ([@ONordbjerg](https://twitter.com/ONordbjerg)).
