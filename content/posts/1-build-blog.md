Hello. ðŸ‘‹

I've started a blog. For the 7th time.

I think we all have strong perceptions of who we want to be, and those perceptions rarely match reality. Writing is a [good skill to acquire][fcc-writing] and I've wanted to do so for the longest time, but I never dedicate time to it â€” and whenever I do, I usually end up deleting my half-done scribbles.

Obviously, the only way to get better at something is to do it. I've tried blogging before, but I always want to cover too many topics, and my blog always ends up feeling unstructured, so I nuke it.

This time I will try to do something a bit different. I'll have three categories of writings on my blog:

- **Scribbles**: Things I think about and what I think about them. I'll narrow this category to things I've thought a lot about.
- **Maths Quests**: I've always been super interested in maths, so this category is for interesting maths problems and visualisations.
- **Coding Quests**: I'm a programmer by trade, so this category is for interesting new things I learn in that space. An adventure, of sorts.

Anyway. I suppose we will see if I can keep this blog alive. I hope my writing wasn't too bad this time around.
